## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 10.2+

You can also use Adapty SDK in Swift and Objective-C applications.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

1. Create a Podfile if you don't have one: `pod init`
2. Add Adapty to your Podfile: `pod 'Adapty', '~> 1.6.0'`
3. Save the file and run: `pod install`. This creates an `.xcworkspace` file for your app. Use this file for all future development on your application.

### Swift Package Manager

1. In Xcode go to `File` > `Swift Packages` > `Add Package Dependency...`
2. Enter `https://github.com/adaptyteam/AdaptySDK-iOS.git` 
3. Choose a version and click `Next` and Xcode will add the package dependency to your project.

## Configure your app

In your AppDelegate class:

```Swift
import Adapty
```

And add the following to `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`:

```Swift
Adapty.activate("PUBLIC_SDK_KEY", customerUserId: "YOUR_USER_ID")
```

If your app doesn't have user IDs, you can use **`.activate("PUBLIC_SDK_KEY")`** or pass nil for the **`customerUserId`**. Anyway, you can update **`customerUserId`** later within [**`.identify()`** request](https://github.com/adaptyteam/AdaptySDK-iOS/blob/master/Documentation/AdvancedUsage.md#convert-anonymous-user-to-identifiable-user).

## Debugging

Adapty will log errors and other important information to help you understand what is going on. There are three levels available: **`verbose`**, **`errors`** and **`none`** in case you want a bit of a silence.
You can set this immediately in your app while testing, before you configure Adapty.

```Swift
Adapty.logLevel = .verbose
```

## Advanced usage
