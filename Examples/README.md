### Adapty Demo Apps

Adapty demo apps are designed to show you how to work with paywalls in Adapty. These apps have minimal functionality, serving as both a tutorial and an example. This section includes apps that use paywalls designed with the Paywall Builder.

Below, you'll find two iOS apps:

- [AdaptyRecipes-SwiftUI](AdaptyRecipes-SwiftUI/README.md):  built with SwiftUI using Swift Package Manager for dependency management.
- [AdaptyRecipes-UIKit](AdaptyRecipes-UIKit/README.md): built with UIKit using CocoaPods for dependency management.

Both apps have the same functionality, but they use different technologies.
